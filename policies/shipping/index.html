Shipping Policy for Print on Demand Shop XFasso

At XFasso, we understand the importance of a clear and transparent shipping policy when it comes to delivering our print on demand products to our valued customers. This shipping policy outlines the various aspects of our shipping process, including shipping methods, delivery times, international shipping, tracking information, customs fees, and more. Please read this policy carefully to familiarize yourself with our procedures and ensure a smooth shopping experience.

1. Processing Time:
1.1. Order Verification: Upon receiving your order, our team will carefully review it for accuracy and payment verification. This process usually takes 1-2 business days. In case we require any additional information or clarification, we will reach out to you via the contact information provided during checkout.
1.2. Printing and Production: Once your order passes the verification process, we will initiate the printing and production of your selected items. Our dedicated production team ensures that each product is carefully crafted to meet our quality standards. The printing and production process typically takes 2-5 business days, depending on the complexity of the design and the number of items in your order.

2. Shipping Methods and Delivery Times:
2.1. Domestic Shipping: We offer various shipping options for domestic orders within the specified country. The delivery times and costs may vary based on the shipping method selected during checkout. Standard shipping typically takes 3-7 business days, while expedited shipping may take 1-3 business days. Please note that these estimates are subject to change during peak seasons or unforeseen circumstances.
2.2. International Shipping: For our international customers, we offer shipping options to many countries around the world. The delivery times and costs for international orders may vary significantly based on the destination country, customs procedures, and shipping method selected. International shipping can range from 7 to 30 business days, depending on various factors. Please note that any customs or import duties imposed by the destination country are the responsibility of the customer.

3. Tracking Information:
3.1. Once your order is shipped, we will provide you with a tracking number via email. You can use this tracking number to monitor the progress of your shipment and estimate the expected delivery date. Please allow 24-48 hours for the tracking information to become available in the carrier's system.
3.2. In some cases, multiple items from your order may be shipped separately, depending on their availability or printing requirements. If this happens, we will provide you with separate tracking numbers for each shipment.

4. Address Accuracy:
4.1. It is essential to provide accurate shipping information during the checkout process. Please double-check the shipping address you provide to ensure that it is complete and correct. XFasso will not be responsible for any delays, lost packages, or additional costs incurred due to incorrect or incomplete address information provided by the customer.

5. Order Tracking and Support:
5.1. If you have any questions or concerns regarding your order's shipping status, tracking information, or delivery, please contact our customer support team. Our dedicated representatives will be happy to assist you and provide updates regarding your shipment.

6. Lost or Damaged Packages:

In such cases, please contact our customer support team as soon as possible. We will initiate an investigation with the carrier to resolve the issue promptly and, if necessary, arrange for a replacement or refund according to our refund policy.

7. Holidays and Peak Seasons:
7.1. During holidays, sales events, or peak seasons, such as Black Friday or Christmas, processing and shipping times may be longer than usual due to increased order volumes. We appreciate your patience and understanding during these times, as we strive to fulfill all orders in a timely manner.

8. Changes to Shipping Policy:
8.1. XFasso reserves the right to update or modify this shipping policy at any time without prior notice. Any changes will be effective immediately upon posting the revised policy on our website.
